# Mini Ruby Projects
This repo is just a bunch of "toy" projects that I did for fun or out of boredom

# Featured Programs

* [Bogo Sort](https://github.com/kirby-b/Mini-Ruby-Projects/tree/master/Bogo): A really bad sort algorithm that just randomizes an array until it is sorted
* [Eight Ball](https://github.com/kirby-b/Mini-Ruby-Projects/tree/master/EightBall): Just a magic 8 ball
* [Fizz Buzz](https://github.com/kirby-b/Mini-Ruby-Projects/tree/master/FizzBuzz): Prints a response based on if a number is divisible by three, five, both, or neither.

# How to use

I honestly am not an expert on how to run or compile ruby, This repo is just for me to learn how it works. If I had to guess, your best bet is to run it in an IDE like RubyMine or Atom.
